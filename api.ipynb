    "\n",
    "They define the way and format data that data can be extracted from or sent to an application. One software program wants information and another has stored that information, they can use an api to both ask for and receive data.\n",

    "They facilitate communication by allowing information to be requested, sent deleted or modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs can come in many forms or shapes ie:\n",
    "* Operating system APIs such as turning both the camera and audio to allow one to join a zoom call.\n",
    "* Web APIs for performing web actions example posting a tweet on twitter, liking an image on instagram.\n",
    "\n",

    "* ### Accessing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs are a great way of accessing data that you are interested in. Many websites and web applications give access to their data via an API. In a real-world situation, most of the data that you will be working with would be coming from a database or from an API and in some situations you may even be accessing your database from an API.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ### Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "How does one go from *\"I have built a model with 92%\"* to *\"some user can use an app built around my project to know how much in loan they qualify for?\"*. Ideally, upon building a model that performs some task you don't want to just push it to Git and onto the next, instead you want people to be able to use it. If you work with a team of Software Engineers lucky you, but they wouldn't appreciate you just emailing them a notebook with huges chunks of code so they put it into production. Giving your Software Engineers an API instead of a notebook is definitely going to make their lives slightly easier. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the best ways of making your model usable to other people is by turning it into an API endpoint where people can send data into your API and inturn receive the results of your machine learning model. Models that you build can be great but would inturn be useless if they can't be used by other people."
